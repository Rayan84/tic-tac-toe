# Tic Tac Toe

In this project, we built tic tac toe game from scratch using Ruby progamming language, the project is a requirement in Microverse technical curriculum.

### Game rules and instructions

This game is simple and very popular, it's played by two players, each one gets a distinguished symbol (usually X or O).
The objective for each player is to place own sybmol on three squares that comprise a straight line. The line may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Whoever acheives this goal first wins.
In case of all the squares get occupied without any player winning, it's called a tie or draw.

After every tie or winning, the game will give option to play again or quit by prompting the player to enter Y or N respectivly
